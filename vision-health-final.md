# Your Eyes: What Actually Works (And What Doesn't)

**A research summary compiled from peer-reviewed literature**

---

## 🎯 The One Thing You Need to Know

**Stop using your phone with one eye in the dark.**

This isn't generic advice — it's based on your specific behavior pattern. There's a documented phenomenon called **Transient Smartphone Blindness (TSB)** that you may be triggering regularly.

---

## ⚠️ YOUR SPECIFIC SITUATION: Transient Smartphone Blindness

### What's happening when you use your phone with one eye in bed:

When you view a bright screen with ONE eye while the other is buried in a pillow, you create **asymmetric light adaptation**:

- **Screen eye:** Adapts to bright light (photoreceptors bleached)
- **Pillow eye:** Stays dark-adapted

When you put the phone down, the light-adapted eye **temporarily can't see in the dark** — sometimes for up to 15 minutes.

### Why this matters:

This exact phenomenon was documented in the *New England Journal of Medicine* (PMID: 27301710). Patients showed up at emergency departments with what looked like symptoms of stroke, MS, or vascular disease. They got MRIs, CT scans, cardiac workups — only for doctors to eventually figure out it was phone use.

Your symptoms are consistent with Transient Smartphone Blindness, a documented phenomenon. **However, any vision changes should be evaluated by an eye care provider to rule out other causes** — don't self-diagnose based on this document alone.

### The fix:

- **Both eyes open, always** — even if lying on your side
- **Ambient light on** — never view screens in total darkness
- **Sit up if possible** — removes the "one eye in pillow" temptation

> 📱 **Note:** If you're experiencing these symptoms, addressing this behavior may resolve them. But get checked out first to rule out other causes.

## FOR YOUR KIDS: Myopia Prevention

This has strong research support, and it's directly relevant to your family.

### What works: Outdoor time

**Multiple studies have found similar results:**

- **Guangzhou RCT** (1,903 kids, 3 years): 40 extra minutes outdoors during school → 23% reduction in new myopia cases in that study population (PMID: 26372583)
- **Taiwan school programs**: Showed similar protective effects in their populations
- **Sydney study**: 4,132 children — outdoor time was protective regardless of whether they were doing sports or just sitting outside

**Why it works:** It's about light intensity, not exercise. Outdoor light (10,000-100,000 lux) triggers retinal dopamine release, which inhibits eye elongation. Indoor light (100-500 lux) doesn't cut it.

**Target: 2+ hours outside daily**

This works best for **preventing** myopia. Once myopia develops, outdoor time helps less for slowing progression.

### What also works (if they already have myopia):

| Intervention | Effectiveness | Notes |
|--------------|---------------|-------|
| **Low-dose atropine** (0.01-0.05%) | Studies suggest ~50% slower progression (results vary by study and individual) | Prescription, nightly drops. Discuss with pediatric ophthalmologist |
| **Orthokeratology** (ortho-K) | Studies suggest ~45-50% slower progression | Overnight contacts. Higher infection risk than daytime contacts |
| **MiSight/multifocal contacts** | Clinical trials showed ~59% slower progression | FDA-approved option. Daily disposables |
| **DIMS spectacle lenses** | Studies showed ~52% slower progression | Special lenses, not regular glasses |

*Note: These percentages come from specific clinical trials and may not apply to all individuals. Discuss options with a pediatric ophthalmologist.*

### What DOESN'T work:

❌ **Under-correcting their glasses** — This might actually make myopia WORSE (PMID: 12445849). Don't let anyone tell you full correction is "bad for their eyes."

❌ **Eye exercises or vision therapy** — We found no high-quality RCT evidence for myopia prevention

❌ **Just limiting screen time** — The evidence is weak and inconsistent. Outdoor time is what matters.

## DAILY SCREEN USE: What Actually Helps Eye Strain

### Digital eye strain is real. Here's what's happening:

- Your blink rate drops from 15-20/min → 4-6/min when viewing screens
- Blinks become incomplete (doesn't fully resurface tear film)
- Focusing muscles stay clenched at one distance
- Your eyes dry out

This causes real discomfort. It's not "in your head."

### What helps:

**Screen breaks** — The 20-20-20 rule (every 20 minutes, look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds) makes physiological sense. Evidence is limited but there's no downside.

**Preservative-free artificial tears** — Address the dryness component. Use as needed. "Preservative-free" matters if you're using them 4+ times daily.

**Deliberate blinking** — Sounds stupid. Actually helps.

**Ergonomics:**
- Screen 20-26 inches from eyes
- Screen center slightly below eye level
- Match room lighting to screen brightness
- Increase font size (farther = less strain)

### Warm compresses for tired, gritty eyes:

If your eyes feel "gritty" or tired at day's end, you may have meibomian gland dysfunction (clogged oil glands in your eyelids).

Warm compresses (10-15 minutes, 1-2x daily) can help. Heat loosens the oils. Evidence is generally supportive but comes mostly from smaller studies rather than large RCTs.

## 💸 SAVE YOUR MONEY: Where Marketing Outpaces Evidence

You asked for evidence-based, hype-free advice. Here's where the marketing doesn't match the research:

### Blue Light Blocking Glasses

**Marketing claim:** Protect your eyes from harmful screen light! Reduce eye strain!

**What the evidence says:**
- Cochrane Review 2023 (17 RCTs): "We are uncertain whether blue-light filtering lenses reduce eye strain"
- Systematic Review 2017 (PMID: 29044670): Found no evidence of benefit for eye strain
- American Academy of Ophthalmology: "There is no scientific evidence that blue light from digital devices causes damage to your eye"

**Reality:** You get more blue light from 10 minutes outside than from a full day of screen use.

**Verdict:** Skip them. They're not harmful, but current evidence doesn't support the claims.

> 💡 **What actually helps sleep:** Using night/warm mode on your devices in the evening, or just... putting the phone down before bed. You don't need special glasses.

---

### Omega-3 Supplements for Dry Eye

**Marketing claim:** Fish oil supports healthy eyes and tear production!

**What the evidence says:**
- **DREAM Study** (PMID: 29652551): 535 people with moderate-to-severe dry eye, 12 months, high-quality RCT
- Result: **No significant difference** between omega-3s and placebo
- Both groups improved similarly — meaning the placebo did just as well

**Verdict:** Disappointing. Omega-3s were promising in observational studies but fell flat in the rigorous trial. Save your money for fish dinners if you like fish.

---

### Bilberry Supplements

**Marketing claim:** "Supports night vision!" (Often citing WWII RAF pilots)

**What the evidence says:**
- The RAF pilot story has been questioned — some historians suggest it may have been wartime misdirection to conceal radar technology, though this isn't definitively established
- Systematic review (PMID: 14711439): "Insufficient evidence to support use for night vision"
- Most rigorous trials were negative

**Verdict:** Marketing vastly exceeds evidence.

---

### Vitamin D for Eye Health

**The claim:** Observational studies link low vitamin D to eye problems.

**The reality:** We found no RCT evidence that vitamin D supplements help eyes specifically. If you're deficient, fix it for general health. Don't take it expecting eye benefits.

## SUPPLEMENTS THAT ACTUALLY WORK (But Probably Not For You)

### AREDS2 Formula: Supported by Large RCT — For the Right People

The AREDS2 trial was a major NIH-funded study (4,203 participants, 5 years). In that trial, the formula reduced AMD progression by about 25% in participants with intermediate or advanced AMD.

**The formula:**
- Vitamin C: 500 mg
- Vitamin E: 400 IU
- Lutein: 10 mg
- Zeaxanthin: 2 mg
- Zinc: 80 mg (or 25 mg)
- Copper: 2 mg

**Who should take it:**
- People with **intermediate AMD** (drusen, pigment changes)
- People with **advanced AMD in one eye**

**Who should NOT take it:**
- People without AMD or early AMD
- Not for general "eye health" or prevention in healthy eyes

> ⚡ **Note:** Unless an eye doctor has told you that you have intermediate or advanced AMD, this supplement probably isn't for you. It's not a general-purpose "eye vitamin."

## The Takeaway

> **Many heavily marketed products lack strong supporting evidence**, while simpler interventions often have better research behind them.
>
> Outdoor time, screen breaks, proper lighting, and artificial tears have decent evidence. Blue light glasses, bilberry, and most supplements don't.
>
> **Your personal priority:** If you're having temporary vision issues from one-eyed phone use in the dark, fixing that habit may help — but see an eye doctor to rule out other causes first.
