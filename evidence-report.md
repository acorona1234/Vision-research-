## 1. SUPPLEMENTS FOR EYE HEALTH

### 1.1 Lutein + Zeaxanthin (Macular Carotenoids)

**What they do:** Lutein and zeaxanthin are carotenoids that accumulate in the macula, forming macular pigment. They act as blue light filters and antioxidants, potentially protecting against oxidative damage to photoreceptors.

**Evidence Level: Strong (Large RCT)**

#### Key Study: AREDS2 Trial
- **PMID:** 23644932
- **Design:** Multicenter, randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled RCT
- **N:** 4,203 participants (50-85 years), followed 5 years (2006-2012)
- **Population:** People at risk for AMD progression (bilateral large drusen or AMD in one eye)
- **Dosage:** Lutein 10 mg + Zeaxanthin 2 mg daily

**Results:**
- Primary analysis: **No statistically significant reduction** in progression to advanced AMD vs placebo
  - HR 0.90 (98.7% CI: 0.76-1.07), p=0.12
- However, in participants with **lowest dietary intake of lutein/zeaxanthin**, there was benefit
- Secondary analysis removing beta-carotene from AREDS formula: lutein/zeaxanthin showed 18% reduction in AMD progression

**Important Finding:** Beta-carotene significantly increased lung cancer risk in former smokers (2.0% vs 0.9%, p=0.04), so lutein/zeaxanthin is the **recommended carotenoid substitute** in the AREDS2 formula.

**Current AREDS2 Formula:**
- Vitamin C: 500 mg
- Vitamin E: 400 IU
- Lutein: 10 mg
- Zeaxanthin: 2 mg
- Zinc: 80 mg (or 25 mg in modified version)
- Copper: 2 mg

**Who benefits:** Those with intermediate AMD or advanced AMD in one eye. **NOT recommended for general prevention** in people without AMD risk factors.

**Risks:** Generally well-tolerated. High-dose zinc may cause GI upset.

---

### 1.2 Omega-3 Fatty Acids (DHA + EPA)

**What they do:** DHA is a structural component of retinal photoreceptors. Omega-3s have anti-inflammatory properties relevant to dry eye and potentially AMD.

**Evidence Level: Mixed - Negative for AMD, Disappointing for Dry Eye**

#### For AMD Prevention (AREDS2)
- **PMID:** 23644932
- **Dosage:** DHA 350 mg + EPA 650 mg daily
- **Result:** **No significant effect** on AMD progression
  - HR 0.97 (98.7% CI: 0.82-1.16), p=0.70
- **Conclusion:** Not recommended for AMD prevention despite earlier observational studies suggesting benefit

#### For Dry Eye Disease - DREAM Study
- **PMID:** 29652551 (Dry Eye Assessment and Management Study, NEJM 2018)
- **Design:** Multicenter RCT, N=535, 12 months
- **Dosage:** EPA 2000 mg + DHA 1000 mg daily vs olive oil placebo
- **Population:** Moderate-to-severe dry eye disease

**Results:**
- **NO significant difference** between omega-3 and placebo groups in symptoms or signs
- Both groups improved similarly (~30% improved in each)
- **Challenged** earlier positive observational studies

**⚠️ Status: Disappointing RCT results after promising observational data. Omega-3s likely NOT effective for typical dry eye when added to standard therapy.**

Cochrane Review on omega-3s:
- **PMID:** 31847055 (Downie et al., Cochrane 2019)
- Title: "Omega-3 and omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids for dry eye disease"
- Concluded evidence is uncertain/mixed, noting heterogeneity in studies

**Risks:** Generally safe. May increase bleeding risk at very high doses. Fish burps common.

---

### 1.3 Zinc

**What it does:** Essential mineral concentrated in the retina, involved in vitamin A metabolism and antioxidant enzyme function.

**Evidence Level: Moderate (part of AREDS formulas)**

#### Evidence:
- Original AREDS showed zinc 80 mg reduced progression to advanced AMD by 21%
- **PMID:** 11594942 (original AREDS)
- AREDS2 tested lower dose (25 mg) - no significant difference from 80 mg

**Dosage:** 25-80 mg daily (must include 2 mg copper to prevent copper deficiency)

**Who benefits:** Those with intermediate or advanced AMD

**Risks:** GI upset at high doses, copper deficiency without supplementation

---

### 1.4 Vitamin D

**What it does:** Theoretical anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects

**Evidence Level: Weak - Observational only**

- Some observational studies link low vitamin D to higher AMD risk
- **NO RCT evidence** supporting vitamin D supplementation for eye health specifically
- **Not recommended** for eye-specific supplementation

---

### 1.5 Bilberry / Anthocyanins

**Evidence Level: Very Weak - Marketing exceeds evidence**

- Popular supplement marketed for "eye health" and "night vision"
- Claims originated from WWII RAF pilot anecdotes (likely propaganda)
- **Systematic Review (PMID: 14711439):** Canter & Ernst, Survey of Ophthalmology 2004 - "Anthocyanosides of Vaccinium myrtillus (bilberry) for night vision--a systematic review of placebo-controlled trials" - Found insufficient evidence to support use for night vision; most rigorous trials were negative
- Small studies show possible improvements in visual fatigue but high risk of bias

**⚠️ Not recommended - insufficient evidence**

---

## 2. MYOPIA PREVENTION & SLOWING

### 2.1 Outdoor Time

**What it does:** Bright light exposure stimulates retinal dopamine release, which inhibits axial elongation. Light intensity outdoors (10,000-100,000 lux) far exceeds indoor lighting (100-500 lux).

**Evidence Level: Strong (Multiple RCTs and cohort studies)**

#### Key Studies:

**Sydney Myopia Study:**
- **PMID:** 18294691
- Cross-sectional study of 4,132 children
- Found strong protective effect of outdoor activity, independent of physical activity

**Guangzhou Randomized Trial:**
- **PMID:** 26372583
- **Design:** Cluster RCT, 1,903 children, 3-year follow-up
- **Intervention:** Additional 40 minutes outdoor activity during school
- **Result:** 23% reduction in incident myopia (30.4% vs 39.5%, p<0.001)
- 3-year cumulative incidence: 30.4% (intervention) vs 39.5% (control)

**Taiwan School-Based Outdoor Program:**
- **PMID:** 29371008 (Wu et al., Ophthalmology 2018)
- Title: "Myopia Prevention and Outdoor Light Intensity in a School-Based Cluster Randomized Trial"
- Implementation of outdoor recess programs showed protective effects
- Identified protective light intensity thresholds

**Recommended Dose:** **≥2 hours/day outdoors** appears protective

**Key Points:**
- Effect is from **light exposure, not physical activity**
- Works best for **myopia prevention** in non-myopic children
- Less effective for **slowing progression** once myopia established
- Hat/sunglasses still allow sufficient light

**Risks:** Sun protection still needed for skin (hat, sunscreen). Eye protection for UV is built-in (cornea/lens filter most UV).

### 2.2 Low-Dose Atropine Eye Drops

**What it does:** Muscarinic receptor antagonist. Mechanism for myopia control unclear but may involve non-accommodative retinal/scleral signaling pathways.

**Evidence Level: Strong (Multiple RCTs)**

#### Key Studies:

**ATOM1 Trial (Singapore):**
- **PMID:** 16996612 (Chua et al., Ophthalmology 2006)
- Title: "Atropine for the treatment of childhood myopia"
- 1% atropine highly effective but significant side effects (photophobia, near blur)
- Significant rebound after cessation

**ATOM2 Trial (Low-dose comparison):**
- **PMID:** 21963266 (Chia et al., Ophthalmology 2012) - 2-year results
- **PMID:** 26271839 (Chia et al., Ophthalmology 2016) - 5-year follow-up
- **Design:** RCT comparing 0.5%, 0.1%, 0.01% atropine
- N=400 children ages 6-12, followed 5 years

**Results:**
- 0.01% atropine: **Slowed progression by ~50%** with minimal side effects
- 0.01% had **least rebound** after stopping treatment
- Best balance of efficacy and tolerability

**LAMP Study (Hong Kong):**
- **PMID:** 30514630
- Compared 0.05%, 0.025%, 0.01% atropine
- Found 0.05% most effective (67% reduction in progression)
- 0.01% less effective in this study (~27% reduction)

**Current Recommendations:**
- **0.01% to 0.05% atropine** nightly
- Start treatment early in myopia progression
- Continue for several years (optimal duration unclear)
- Available by compounding pharmacy prescription

**Risks:**
- Mild photophobia (less with low doses)
- Possible near blur (minimal at 0.01%)
- Long-term safety data still accumulating
- Rebound myopia progression possible after stopping

### 2.3 Orthokeratology (Ortho-K)

**What it does:** Overnight rigid contact lens reshapes cornea, providing temporary myopia correction. Also appears to slow axial elongation.

**Evidence Level: Moderate (Multiple controlled studies, some RCTs)**

#### Evidence:
- **PMID:** 15875367 (LORIC Study - Cho et al., Curr Eye Res 2005)
  - Title: "The longitudinal orthokeratology research in children (LORIC) in Hong Kong"
- **PMID:** 22969068 (ROMIO Study - Cho et al., Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci 2012)
  - Title: "Retardation of myopia in Orthokeratology (ROMIO) study: a 2-year randomized clinical trial"
- Multiple studies show ~45-50% reduction in axial elongation vs spectacles/soft contacts

**Mechanism:** May be related to peripheral retinal defocus patterns

**Risks:**
- Higher microbial keratitis risk than daytime contacts (requires excellent hygiene)
- Requires ongoing lens care and regular practitioner visits
- Expensive

---

### 2.4 Multifocal/Peripheral Defocus Contact Lenses

**What it does:** Creates myopic defocus in peripheral retina, theorized to signal slower eye growth.

**Evidence Level: Moderate-Strong (RCTs)**

#### Key Study: MiSight® 1 day lens
- **PMID:** 31343513 (Chamberlain et al., Optom Vis Sci 2019)
- Title: "A 3-year Randomized Clinical Trial of MiSight Lenses for Myopia Control"
- **Design:** RCT, N=144, 3-year
- **Result:** 59% reduction in myopia progression vs standard contacts
- **Note:** This is the MiSight clinical trial, distinct from the separate BLINK study

#### DIMS spectacle lens (Defocus Incorporated Multiple Segments):
- **PMID:** 31142465 (Lam et al., Br J Ophthalmol 2020)
- Title: "Defocus Incorporated Multiple Segments (DIMS) spectacle lenses slow myopia progression: a 2-year randomised clinical trial"
- ~52% reduction in myopia progression

**FDA-approved options emerging for clinical use**

### 2.5 What DOESN'T Work for Myopia

❌ **Under-correction of glasses** - Actually may WORSEN myopia (PMID: 12445849)  
❌ **Vision therapy/eye exercises** - No evidence for myopia prevention  
❌ **Reducing near work alone** - Weak/inconsistent evidence (outdoor time more important)  
❌ **Blue light blocking glasses** - No evidence for myopia effects

---

## 3. DIGITAL EYE STRAIN (Computer Vision Syndrome)

### 3.1 What Actually Happens

Digital eye strain is a real phenomenon involving:
- Reduced blink rate (normal: 15-20/min → screen use: 4-6/min)
- Incomplete blinks
- Sustained accommodation and convergence
- Potential ocular surface dryness

**NOT caused by:** Screens emitting harmful radiation, blue light damage

### 3.2 The 20-20-20 Rule

**What it is:** Every 20 minutes, look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds.

**Evidence Level: Weak - Logical but limited RCT evidence**

- Based on sound physiological principles (relaxes accommodation)
- Widely recommended by professional organizations despite limited formal evidence
- Low cost, no risk - reasonable to recommend

**Reality check:** Compliance is poor in real-world settings

### 3.3 Artificial Tears / Lubricating Drops

**Evidence Level: Moderate**

- Preservative-free artificial tears shown to improve symptoms
- Can address the reduced blinking/dryness component

**Recommended:** Use PRN, preferably preservative-free for frequent use

### 3.4 Proper Ergonomics

**Evidence Level: Expert consensus, limited formal studies**

Best practices:
- Screen 20-26 inches from eyes
- Screen center 4-5 inches below eye level
- Matte screen or anti-glare filter
- Adjust room lighting to match screen brightness
- Increase text size if straining

### 3.5 Blinking Exercises

**Evidence Level: Weak-Moderate**

- Deliberate complete blinks may help restore tear film
- Limited but supportive evidence

---

## 4. BLUE LIGHT - SEPARATING FACT FROM HYPE

### 4.1 The Marketing Claims vs Science

**Marketing claims:**
- Blue light from screens damages retinas
- Blue light blocking glasses prevent eye strain
- Blue light glasses improve sleep

**What the evidence actually shows:**

#### For Eye Strain/Visual Performance

**Key Systematic Review:**
- **PMID:** 29044670 (Lawrenson et al., 2017)
- **Title:** "The effect of blue-light blocking spectacle lenses on visual performance, macular health and the sleep-wake cycle"
- **Design:** Systematic review of RCTs
- **Included:** 3 studies, 136 participants

**Findings:**
- **No observed difference** in contrast sensitivity between blue-blocking and clear lenses
- **No evidence** of inter-group differences for eyestrain symptoms
- **No studies** investigating effects on macular structure/function
- **Conclusion:** "We find a lack of high quality evidence to support using BB spectacle lenses for the general population to improve visual performance or sleep quality, alleviate eye fatigue or conserve macular health."

**Cochrane Review 2023:**
- **PMID:** 37593770 (Singh et al., Cochrane Database Syst Rev 2023)
- Title: "Blue-light filtering spectacle lenses for visual performance, sleep, and macular health in adults"
- Examined 17 RCTs with sample sizes from 5 to 156 participants
- **Conclusion:** "We are uncertain whether blue‐light filtering lenses reduce eye strain or protect macular health"

#### For Retinal Damage

**Laboratory vs Real-World:**
- Lab studies (cell cultures, animal models) use **much higher** blue light intensities than any screen emits
- Screens emit far less blue light than natural sunlight
- No evidence screen blue light causes retinal damage in humans
- American Academy of Ophthalmology: "There is no scientific evidence that blue light from digital devices causes damage to your eye"

**Reality:** You get more blue light from walking outside for 10 minutes than from a day of screen use.

#### For Sleep

**This is where there IS evidence:**
- **PMID:** 25535358 (Chang et al., PNAS 2015) - Blue light at night suppresses melatonin
- Evening screen use CAN disrupt circadian rhythm
- BUT: This is about **timing**, not about wearing special glasses all day

**What actually helps sleep:**
- Avoid screens 1-2 hours before bed
- Use device night mode/warm colors in evening
- Or simply... dim the screen/turn it off

**Blue light glasses are NOT necessary** - just change behavior or use device settings.

### 4.2 Summary on Blue Light

| Claim | Evidence |
|-------|----------|
| Screens damage retinas | ❌ No evidence |
| Blue light glasses reduce eye strain | ❌ No quality evidence |
| Blue light glasses improve sleep | ⚠️ Unnecessary - behavior change/settings work |
| Blue light glasses protect macular health | ❌ No evidence |

**Bottom line:** Blue light blocking glasses are largely a marketing phenomenon without clinical support. They're not harmful, but they're probably not helpful either. **Save your money.**

## 6. RECOMMENDATIONS SUMMARY

### Strong Evidence - Recommend:
✅ **Outdoor time for children** (≥2 hours/day) - myopia prevention  
✅ **AREDS2 formula** - for intermediate/advanced AMD only  
✅ **Low-dose atropine** (0.01-0.05%) - myopia progression in children (specialist supervision)  
✅ **Preservative-free artificial tears** - dry eye/digital eye strain  
✅ **Screen breaks** - digital eye strain (20-20-20 or similar)

### Moderate Evidence - Consider:
⚠️ **Orthokeratology** - myopia control (with understanding of risks)  
⚠️ **Multifocal contacts/DIMS lenses** - myopia control  
⚠️ **Warm compresses** - meibomian gland dysfunction  
⚠️ **Night mode on devices** - evening screen use for sleep

### Weak/No Evidence - Skip:
❌ **Blue light blocking glasses** - not supported by evidence  
❌ **Omega-3s for dry eye** - disappointing RCT results (DREAM)  
❌ **Bilberry supplements** - marketing exceeds evidence  
❌ **Vitamin D for eyes** - no RCT evidence  
❌ **Under-correcting glasses** - may worsen myopia

## 7. GAPS IN EVIDENCE / NEEDS MORE RESEARCH

1. **Long-term atropine safety** - Multi-decade follow-up needed
2. **Combination myopia therapies** - Atropine + ortho-K together?
3. **Optimal outdoor time dose** - Is more always better?
4. **Gene-environment interactions in myopia** - Who responds to interventions?
5. **Digital eye strain optimal interventions** - Better RCT evidence needed
6. **Blue light and long-term macular health** - Longitudinal human studies
