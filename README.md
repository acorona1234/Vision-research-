## Key Findings

### ✅ What Works (Strong Evidence)
- **Outdoor time for kids** (2+ hrs/day) — prevents myopia
- **Low-dose atropine** (0.01-0.05%) — slows myopia progression ~50%
- **AREDS2 formula** — but ONLY for intermediate/advanced AMD
- **Screen breaks** — 20-20-20 rule for digital eye strain
- **Preservative-free artificial tears** — for dry eye/strain

### ❌ What Doesn't Work (Despite Marketing)
- **Blue light blocking glasses** — no quality evidence for eye strain or protection
- **Omega-3s for dry eye** — DREAM trial showed no benefit vs placebo
- **Bilberry supplements** — marketing exceeds evidence
- **Under-correcting kids' glasses** — may actually worsen myopia
