# Vision Health Research

A research summary compiled from peer-reviewed literature — what the evidence supports, what it doesn't, and where marketing outpaces the science.

## Key Findings

### ✅ What Works (Supported by Multiple RCTs)
- **Outdoor time for kids** (2+ hrs/day) — multiple studies show protective effect against myopia development
- **Low-dose atropine** (0.01-0.05%) — studies suggest may slow myopia progression by roughly 50%, though results vary
- **AREDS2 formula** — but ONLY for intermediate/advanced AMD
- **Screen breaks** — 20-20-20 rule for digital eye strain
- **Preservative-free artificial tears** — for dry eye/strain

### ❌ What Lacks Supporting Evidence (Despite Marketing)
- **Blue light blocking glasses** — we found no high-quality RCT evidence for eye strain or protection benefits
- **Omega-3s for dry eye** — DREAM trial showed no benefit vs placebo
- **Bilberry supplements** — marketing exceeds evidence
- **Under-correcting kids' glasses** — may actually worsen myopia

## Methodology

Research compiled from peer-reviewed literature (PubMed). PMIDs were checked for existence and basic relevance using AI tools. This is not equivalent to expert review — readers should verify primary sources for medical decisions. See audit files for verification details.
